- Possibly make data classes perfectly mirror database they are attached to, however that would require some sort of caching so that only data
that is the "difference" between the current data gets saved. Possibly a "changes" dictionary that gets updated whenever anything
gets set, and when a save happens it only reads off that dictionary. NOT A GUARANTEE, as getting multiple keys is slow as balls and having only one load/store
although it's a lot of data is faster

- Permissions and checks for subcommands don't check parents, not an issue atm but may be later
